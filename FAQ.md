### PopcornTime/TopShelf has conflicting provisioning settings.

`PopcornTime/TopShelf is automatically provisioned, but provisioning profile WildCard has been manually specified. Set the provisioning profile value to "Automatic" in the build settings editor, or switch to manual provisioning in the target editor.

### Any chance of an iPA?

Absolutely not. Archiving an iPA requires a paid developer account which can be traced back to the individual developer. It is against Apple's developer ToS to distribute apps like this and we may have our developer accounts confiscated permanently.

There are plenty of guides on Youtube about how to do it, so if you want it, you can pay for a developer account and archive it yourself.

### The iPA that I downloaded from *x* isn't working etc.

If you download an iPA from anywhere on the internet, first off we cannot guarantee it's authenticity and it might just be stealing your data, and second off we will not respond to your issue posts. Because we don't provide an official iPA for reasons explained above, we have no idea what exact version you are running or if the problem is with our app, or with the things the distributer may have done to it.
